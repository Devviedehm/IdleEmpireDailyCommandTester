# IdleEmpireDailyCommandTester
A simple HTML page that lets you try out the results of the !daily command from the Idle-Empire.com Discord, and compare which thresholds work best.

Please note: The command should be used as !daily &lt;threshold> (for example: !daily 65 )

The source code is also fully readable (though not commented), if you want to take a look at how I coded everything.

You can try it for yourself here:

And here's a screenshot of a previous test run, using a total of 445,300,000 rolls (nearly half a billion):

I hope this has been helpful, and please let me know if you have any problems with it. :)
